#Tutorial 1: String 
In this first tutorial we start with a simple text string, like in each coding language we need to print some information to the screen.

With python you can do this very easy with the print() command.

- Open first your favorite text editor, this can be anything.
- Enter the follow line of text in it: print("hello world")
- Save the file like main.py, be sure that your file ends with .py

Well done, this is your first peace of code, now let we check if the code is working.
