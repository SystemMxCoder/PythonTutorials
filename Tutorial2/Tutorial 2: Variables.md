#Tutorial 2: Variables

In this part we dig in with variables, we will learn what a variable is and how we can create one.
Later on we start to make some different variables and fill them with different data.

First of all what is a variable, a variable is nothing more then a placeholder that holds some information that can be used later on in your code, it can hold any type of data. Let's start creating some variables and see how they work they same with different data type.

- Open your text editor and create a new file, name it anything but be sure that it ends with .py
- Now write the follow code: *name="willie"*
- Save the file and run the script in your command prompt / terminal

As you see, your code didn't return anything to the screen. This is correct because a variable itself doesn't display anything at all. Let's a line of code more to print it on the screen

- Return to your code in your code editor.
- Under the line *name="willie"* place the follow code: *print(name)*
- If everything is correct you will now see in your terminal willie

This second line of code prints the variable name that contains willie.
