#Tutorial 2: Input and Raw_input
In this tutorial we go a little bit deeper, in the first tutorial we see how we can print some text on the screen.
The only problem with this text is that it only can be edited by the programmer and in some particular ways we need the users input.
Let's check how Python can handle this.

Python can handle this in two ways with two different in-build functions, the functions are the input() and raw_input() function.
Although they do the same (fetch the users input) they handle the input different.

###How to use input()
The input() function is a function where a user can return a syntactically correct python statement, this can be for example a integer.
Let's test something.

*For this tutorial you need the source code that you can find in de source folder, look for the file input.py for refference*
